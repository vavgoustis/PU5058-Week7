 My personal repository for Week 7 Activities in the Introduction to Health Data Science class at the University of Aberdeen.
 
### Exercise 1: 
For the alcohol-related hospital admission data per intermediate data zone (the data we used in the previous section), plot the data distributions for each health board in 2019.

### Exercise 2: 
For which health boards do we have data on alcohol-related hospital admissions for each deprivation quintile? (Hint: you can use the same geography dataset with intermediate zones that we used in the previous section to find the health board names. But there may be more suitable datasets on the geography codes and labels page.)

### Exercise 3: 
Create boxplots showing alcohol admissions for each deprivation quintile. Create a different plot for each health board in the data set.
