```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load packages
```{r load-packages, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
```
## Read in data
```{r read-data}
# alcohol-related hospital admissions by health board
admissions_data <- read_csv(here("01_Input/alcohol_related_admissions.csv")) 
deprivation_data <- read_csv(here("01_Input/alcohol-admissions_deprivation-data.csv")) 
head(admissions_data)
head(deprivation_data)
```
## Exercise 1: For the alcohol-related hospital admission data per intermediate data zone (the data we used in the previous section), plot the data distributions for each health board in 2019.
```{r}
hb_admissions_data <- admissions_data %>% filter(year==2019)

hb_admissions_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=alcohol_admissions, fill=health_board,position = "dodge")) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) +
  labs(x = "Alcohol Admissions") +
  facet_wrap(~ health_board)

```
## Exercise 2: For which health boards do we have data on alcohol-related hospital admissions for each deprivation quintile?
```{r}
glimpse(deprivation_data)
```
